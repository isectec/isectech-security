# Task ID: 38
# Title: Implement Multi-Tenant Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 26, 27, 29, 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the multi-tenant capabilities required for MSSP support, ensuring complete isolation between tenants while enabling efficient management.
# Details:
Implement a secure multi-tenant architecture with the following features:

1. Tenant Isolation:
   - Data isolation at database level
   - Network isolation between tenants
   - Compute resource isolation
   - API gateway tenant routing
   - Tenant-specific encryption keys

2. Tenant Management:
   - Tenant provisioning and deprovisioning
   - Tenant configuration management
   - Tenant-specific customizations
   - Tenant billing and usage tracking
   - Tenant health monitoring

3. MSSP-Specific Features:
   - Cross-tenant dashboards and reporting
   - Tenant comparison analytics
   - Bulk operations across tenants
   - Hierarchical tenant structures
   - White-labeling capabilities

Technologies to use:
- PostgreSQL row-level security for data isolation
- Kubernetes namespaces for resource isolation
- HashiCorp Vault for tenant-specific secrets
- Custom tenant middleware for API requests
- Tenant context propagation throughout the system

# Test Strategy:
1. Tenant isolation security testing
2. Cross-tenant access attempt testing
3. Tenant provisioning workflow validation
4. Performance testing with multiple active tenants
5. Resource allocation and isolation testing
6. White-labeling functionality testing
7. Tenant migration testing
8. Disaster recovery testing per tenant

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Tenant Data Isolation Strategy [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement data isolation at the database level using PostgreSQL row-level security to ensure each tenant's data is completely segregated.
### Details:
Establish tenant-specific schemas or row-level security policies in PostgreSQL to prevent cross-tenant data access.

## 2. Implement Network Isolation for Tenants [done]
### Dependencies: 38.1
### Description: Configure network policies to ensure network-level isolation between tenants, leveraging Kubernetes namespaces and network policies.
### Details:
Set up Kubernetes namespaces and apply network policies to restrict inter-tenant communication.

## 3. Establish Compute Resource Isolation [done]
### Dependencies: 38.2
### Description: Isolate compute resources for each tenant using Kubernetes resource quotas and namespace-level controls.
### Details:
Configure resource quotas and limits within Kubernetes namespaces to prevent resource contention.

## 4. Develop API Gateway Tenant Routing [done]
### Dependencies: 38.1
### Description: Implement API gateway logic to route requests to the correct tenant context, ensuring tenant-aware request processing.
### Details:
Use custom middleware and API gateway configuration to extract tenant context from requests and enforce routing.

## 5. Integrate Tenant-Specific Encryption Keys [done]
### Dependencies: 38.1
### Description: Provision and manage tenant-specific encryption keys using HashiCorp Vault for data-at-rest and in-transit encryption.
### Details:
Configure Vault to generate and store unique keys per tenant and integrate with application encryption routines.

## 6. Automate Tenant Provisioning and Deprovisioning [done]
### Dependencies: 38.1, 38.2, 38.3, 38.5
### Description: Develop workflows and automation for secure tenant onboarding and offboarding, including resource allocation and cleanup.
### Details:
Implement scripts or services to create/delete tenant resources, apply policies, and manage lifecycle events.

## 7. Implement Tenant Configuration Management [done]
### Dependencies: 38.6
### Description: Build a system for managing tenant-specific configurations, such as feature flags, limits, and preferences.
### Details:
Store and retrieve configuration settings per tenant, supporting overrides and defaults.

## 8. Enable Tenant-Specific Customizations [done]
### Dependencies: 38.7
### Description: Allow tenants to customize aspects of their environment, such as branding, workflows, and integrations.
### Details:
Develop UI and backend support for tenant-level customizations, persisting settings securely.

## 9. Implement Tenant Billing and Usage Tracking [done]
### Dependencies: 38.6
### Description: Track resource usage and billing metrics per tenant to support accurate invoicing and reporting.
### Details:
Integrate metering and billing systems to collect, aggregate, and report tenant-specific usage data.

## 10. Develop Tenant Health Monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: 38.3, 38.6
### Description: Monitor the health and status of tenant environments, including resource utilization and service availability.
### Details:
Implement monitoring agents and dashboards to track tenant-specific metrics and alert on anomalies.

## 11. Build Cross-Tenant Dashboards and Reporting [done]
### Dependencies: 38.9, 38.10
### Description: Create dashboards and reports that aggregate and compare metrics across multiple tenants for MSSP operators.
### Details:
Develop secure, role-based access to cross-tenant analytics while maintaining tenant data isolation.

## 12. Implement Hierarchical Tenant Structures and White-Labeling [done]
### Dependencies: 38.8, 38.11
### Description: Support hierarchical tenant relationships (e.g., MSSP, sub-tenant) and enable white-labeling for branding.
### Details:
Design data models and UI to support parent-child tenant structures and tenant-specific branding assets.
