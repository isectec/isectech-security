Use a workflow automation engine (e.g., Camunda, Temporal, or a cloud-native alternative) to manage state, triggers, and conditional logic. Ensure extensibility for future onboarding steps and support for white-labeling. Follow best practices by mapping the customer journey, identifying automation opportunities, and involving stakeholders from product, compliance, and customer success. Prioritize seamless integration with existing systems (CRM, support, analytics) and provide robust analytics for tracking onboarding progress and identifying drop-off points. Implement secure handling of customer data and ensure accessibility and localization support in all onboarding interfaces.

Investigation revealed:\n\n**Missing Implementation:**\n- No email delivery provider integration (SendGrid/Mailgun/SES) wired to onboarding flows\n- Welcome email automation not connected to account provisioning triggers\n- Onboarding checklist reminders lack scheduled delivery mechanism\n- Email template rendering system not integrated with notifications service\n\n**Current State:**\n- All onboarding modules and APIs implemented under app/components/onboarding/** and app/api/onboarding/**\n- Email template definitions exist but lack provider integration\n- Notification framework present but not connected to mailer service\n\n**Recommended Action:**\nTask 68.4 (Welcome Communications and Checklist Automation) should remain pending status until mailer integration implemented. Priority implementation required for email delivery provider configuration, template-to-provider pipeline, and scheduled notification service integration to complete automated onboarding workflow functionality.\n\n**Impact:** Current gap prevents full automation of customer communication touchpoints, requiring manual intervention for welcome messaging and progress reminders during onboarding process.\n</info added on 2025-08-09T00:04:58.773Z>",
