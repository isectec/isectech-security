   - Set up subdomain management for api.isectech.org and docs.isectech.org
   - Implement DNS health monitoring with Cloud Monitoring
   - Configure domain validation and ownership verification through Google Search Console
   - Set up DNS failover mechanisms for high availability

2. SSL Certificate Provisioning and Management:
   - Provision SSL certificates for all domains using Google Cloud Certificate Manager
   - Configure automatic certificate renewal with monitoring alerts for expiration
   - Implement certificate pinning via HTTP headers
   - Set up security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Content-Type-Options)
   - Enable certificate transparency logging for security auditing
   - Implement certificate rotation procedures

3. Cloud Run Domain Mapping:
   - Map custom domains to appropriate Cloud Run services
   - Configure domain routing rules and load balancing
   - Set up domain-specific environment variables for service configuration
   - Implement domain verification through Google Cloud Console
   - Configure custom domain traffic management and scaling policies

4. Production Security and Monitoring:
   - Implement comprehensive security headers for all domains
   - Set up domain monitoring with uptime checks and latency monitoring
   - Configure domain-specific logging with Cloud Logging
   - Implement rate limiting and access controls for domains
   - Set up alerting for domain availability and certificate issues

5. Multi-Environment Domain Management:
   - Configure staging domains (staging.isectech.org) and development domains (dev.isectech.org)
   - Implement environment-specific configurations and routing rules
   - Set up domain testing workflows for pre-production validation
   - Configure domain backup procedures and recovery documentation

Implementation will use Terraform for infrastructure as code with the following key resources:
- google_dns_managed_zone for DNS configuration
- google_certificate_manager_certificate for SSL certificates
- google_cloud_run_domain_mapping for domain mapping
- google_monitoring_uptime_check_config for domain monitoring

All configurations will be version-controlled and deployed through the CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistency across environments.

# Test Strategy:
1. DNS Configuration Testing:
   - Verify DNS propagation for all domains and subdomains
   - Validate A and CNAME records using dig and nslookup
   - Test DNS failover by simulating primary endpoint failure
   - Verify domain ownership validation records

2. SSL Certificate Testing:
   - Validate certificate installation using SSL Labs and testssl.sh
   - Verify certificate chain and trust validation
   - Test certificate renewal process by forcing renewal
   - Validate security headers using securityheaders.com
   - Check certificate transparency logs for proper registration

3. Domain Mapping Testing:
   - Verify all domains resolve to correct Cloud Run services
   - Test domain routing with various request patterns
   - Validate environment variables are correctly applied per domain
   - Test load balancing and traffic distribution
   - Verify domain-specific configurations are applied

4. Security and Performance Testing:
   - Conduct security scanning of all domains
   - Test rate limiting and access controls
   - Perform load testing to verify domain performance
   - Validate monitoring alerts by triggering test conditions
   - Verify logging captures appropriate domain-specific information

5. Multi-Environment Testing:
   - Verify isolation between production, staging, and development domains
   - Test environment-specific configurations
   - Validate domain migration procedures between environments
   - Test backup and recovery procedures

6. End-to-End Testing:
   - Perform user journey testing across all domains
   - Validate cross-domain interactions
   - Test mobile and desktop experiences
   - Verify analytics and monitoring capture all domain traffic
