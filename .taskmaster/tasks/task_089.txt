# Task ID: 89
# Title: Implement SOAR Platform with Automated Response Playbooks
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 88
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement security orchestration workflows with automated response playbooks and incident correlation for the SOAR platform.
# Details:
1. Design SOAR platform architecture
2. Implement security orchestration workflows
3. Develop automated response playbooks
4. Create incident correlation engine
5. Implement executive security dashboards
6. Set up integration with external security tools
7. Develop playbook versioning and change management

SOAR playbook example (YAML format):
```yaml
id: ransomware_containment
name: Ransomware Containment Playbook
version: 1.0.0
description: Automated containment of suspected ransomware activity
triggers:
  - type: alert
    conditions:
      - field: alert.type
        operator: equals
        value: ransomware
      - field: alert.severity
        operator: greater_than_or_equal
        value: high
inputs:
  - name: affected_host
    type: string
    required: true
  - name: affected_user
    type: string
    required: true
steps:
  - id: isolate_host
    name: Isolate Affected Host
    action: endpoint.isolate
    parameters:
      host_id: "{{inputs.affected_host}}"
    on_success: disable_user_account
    on_failure: escalate_to_soc
  
  - id: disable_user_account
    name: Disable User Account
    action: identity.disable_user
    parameters:
      user_id: "{{inputs.affected_user}}"
    on_success: block_iocs
    on_failure: escalate_to_soc
  
  - id: block_iocs
    name: Block Associated IOCs
    action: threat_intel.block_iocs
    parameters:
      alert_id: "{{trigger.alert.id}}"
    on_success: create_incident
    on_failure: create_incident
  
  - id: create_incident
    name: Create Incident Ticket
    action: incident.create
    parameters:
      title: "Ransomware Containment: {{inputs.affected_host}}"
      severity: "{{trigger.alert.severity}}"
      description: "Automated containment actions taken for suspected ransomware on {{inputs.affected_host}} by user {{inputs.affected_user}}"
      affected_assets:
        - "{{inputs.affected_host}}"
      affected_users:
        - "{{inputs.affected_user}}"
    on_success: notify_team
    on_failure: notify_team
  
  - id: notify_team
    name: Notify Security Team
    action: notification.send
    parameters:
      channel: "security-incidents"
      message: "Ransomware containment actions completed for host {{inputs.affected_host}}. Incident ticket created."
  
  - id: escalate_to_soc
    name: Escalate to SOC
    action: incident.escalate
    parameters:
      message: "Automated ransomware containment failed. Immediate SOC attention required."
      severity: critical
```

Implement using a modern SOAR platform like Cortex XSOAR, TheHive with Cortex, or custom implementation with Python and workflow engine.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test playbook execution for various incident types
2. Verify integration with security tools and services
3. Test incident correlation with multiple related alerts
4. Validate executive dashboard metrics and reporting
5. Test playbook versioning and change management
6. Verify automated response actions
7. Test playbook failure handling and escalation
