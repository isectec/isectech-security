# Task ID: 39
# Title: Implement API Gateway and Developer Portal
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 26, 27, 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the API gateway that provides secure access to platform capabilities and a developer portal for API documentation and management.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive API management solution with the following components:

1. API Gateway:
   - Request routing and load balancing
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting and quota management
   - Request/response transformation
   - Caching for performance
   - Analytics and monitoring
   - Circuit breaking for resilience

2. API Security:
   - OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support
   - API keys and JWT validation
   - IP allowlisting/denylisting
   - Request validation and sanitization
   - Threat protection (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
   - mTLS for service-to-service communication

3. Developer Portal:
   - Interactive API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
   - API key management for developers
   - Usage analytics and quotas
   - Code samples and SDKs
   - Sandbox environment for testing
   - Community forums and support

Technologies to use:
- Kong, Tyk, or Ambassador for API gateway
- Swagger UI and ReDoc for API documentation
- OpenAPI 3.1 for API specification
- OAuth 2.1 and OIDC 1.0 for authentication
- API analytics with Prometheus and Grafana

# Test Strategy:
1. API security testing
2. Performance testing for latency and throughput
3. Rate limiting and quota enforcement testing
4. Authentication and authorization validation
5. Documentation accuracy verification
6. Developer experience usability testing
7. SDK functionality testing
8. API versioning and backward compatibility testing

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Deploy API Gateway Core Infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Architect and implement the API gateway using Kong, Tyk, or Ambassador, ensuring robust request routing, load balancing, request/response transformation, caching, and circuit breaking tailored for iSECTECH’s cybersecurity platform.
### Details:
Set up production-grade API gateway infrastructure with high availability, custom domain support, and multi-region failover or weighted routing as needed. Integrate with platform microservices and configure caching, request/response transformation, and circuit breaking for resilience and performance.

## 2. Implement Comprehensive API Security Controls [done]
### Dependencies: 39.1
### Description: Integrate and enforce security features including OAuth 2.1, OpenID Connect 1.0, JWT validation, API keys, mTLS, IP allowlisting/denylisting, request validation/sanitization, and threat protection (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
### Details:
Configure centralized authentication and authorization using OAuth 2.1 and OIDC 1.0, enforce HTTPS for all endpoints, implement API key and JWT validation, enable mTLS for service-to-service communication, and apply IP-based access controls. Deploy request validation and sanitization, and integrate threat protection mechanisms.

## 3. Establish API Rate Limiting, Quota Management, and Analytics [done]
### Dependencies: 39.1, 39.2
### Description: Configure and enforce rate limiting, quota management, and detailed analytics/monitoring for all APIs to ensure fair usage, prevent abuse, and provide operational visibility.
### Details:
Set up granular rate limiting and quota policies per API, client, and tenant. Integrate analytics and monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana, and enable detailed logging and alerting for abnormal usage patterns.

## 4. Develop and Launch Developer Portal with Interactive Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 39.1, 39.2, 39.3
### Description: Build a secure developer portal featuring interactive API documentation (Swagger UI/ReDoc), API key management, usage analytics, code samples, SDKs, and a sandbox environment for testing.
### Details:
Implement the portal with OpenAPI 3.1-based documentation, self-service API key provisioning, real-time usage analytics, downloadable SDKs/code samples, and an isolated sandbox for API testing. Ensure seamless integration with the API gateway and security controls.

## 5. Integrate Community and Support Features into Developer Portal [done]
### Dependencies: 39.4
### Description: Add community forums, support ticketing, and knowledge base features to the developer portal to foster collaboration and provide comprehensive support for API consumers.
### Details:
Deploy and configure community forums, integrate support ticketing workflows, and maintain a searchable knowledge base. Ensure secure access and moderation capabilities aligned with iSECTECH’s requirements.
