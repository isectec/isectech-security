# Task ID: 78
# Title: Develop Trust Score Calculation System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a real-time trust scoring system that calculates trust scores based on user behavior, device posture, and network location for continuous verification.
# Details:
1. Design trust score calculation algorithm with weighted factors
2. Implement data collection for user behavior metrics (login patterns, resource access)
3. Integrate device posture assessment (patch level, security controls, encryption)
4. Incorporate network location and context factors
5. Develop real-time scoring engine using Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
6. Implement Redis (v7.0+) for high-performance score caching
7. Create APIs for trust score retrieval and policy decisions
8. Set up streaming data pipeline using Kafka (v3.4+) for real-time events

Trust score calculation pseudocode:
```python
def calculate_trust_score(user_id, device_id, context):
    # Base score starts at 100
    base_score = 100
    
    # Get user behavior metrics
    user_behavior = get_user_behavior_metrics(user_id)
    behavior_score = analyze_behavior(user_behavior, context)
    
    # Get device posture
    device_posture = get_device_posture(device_id)
    device_score = analyze_device_posture(device_posture)
    
    # Get network context
    network_context = get_network_context(context)
    network_score = analyze_network_context(network_context)
    
    # Calculate weighted score
    trust_score = (behavior_score * 0.4) + (device_score * 0.4) + (network_score * 0.2)
    
    # Apply risk modifiers
    trust_score = apply_risk_modifiers(trust_score, user_id, device_id, context)
    
    return trust_score
```
