# Task ID: 73
# Title: Implement Load Testing and Performance Optimization Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 53, 54
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish a comprehensive load testing framework using k6 or Artillery to evaluate all API endpoints, database operations, and system scalability. Identify and remediate performance bottlenecks, and define performance benchmarks for ongoing monitoring.
# Details:
1. Tool Selection: Evaluate k6 and Artillery for suitability based on scripting needs, integration with CI/CD, reporting, and scalability. k6 is recommended for advanced scripting, distributed testing, and integration with Grafana dashboards, while Artillery offers simplicity and rapid setup for YAML/JavaScript-based scenarios[1][2][3][4][5].

2. Test Scenario Design: Develop load test scripts covering all critical API endpoints, database-intensive operations, and user workflows. Use parameterized and randomized data to simulate realistic usage patterns. For distributed load, leverage k6 operator or Artillery's clustering capabilities to simulate high concurrency and production-like conditions[3][4].

3. Environment Preparation: Set up dedicated, production-like test environments with representative data volumes. Ensure monitoring and logging are enabled for all system components during tests.

4. Execution and Metrics Collection: Run baseline, stress, spike, and endurance tests. Collect metrics on response times, throughput, error rates, resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network), and database performance. Integrate with Grafana or similar dashboards for real-time visualization[1][3].

5. Bottleneck Analysis and Optimization: Analyze test results to identify slow endpoints, database queries, or infrastructure limits. Profile application and database layers to pinpoint root causes. Apply optimizations such as query tuning, caching, connection pooling, and horizontal scaling. Re-test after each optimization to measure impact.

6. Benchmarking and Regression Guardrails: Establish performance benchmarks (e.g., max response time, throughput under load) and integrate load tests into the CI/CD pipeline for ongoing regression detection. Document benchmarks and ensure alerts are configured for threshold breaches.

7. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer: Document test scenarios, scripts, environment setup, and optimization steps. Provide training or walkthroughs for engineering and DevOps teams to maintain and extend the framework.

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate that all critical API endpoints and database operations are covered by load test scripts.
2. Confirm that load tests can simulate expected and peak user loads, including distributed scenarios if required.
3. Verify that performance metrics (response time, throughput, error rates, resource utilization) are accurately collected and reported.
4. Ensure that performance bottlenecks identified during testing are addressed and that optimizations yield measurable improvements.
5. Establish and document performance benchmarks, and verify that these are enforced in the CI/CD pipeline.
6. Review documentation for completeness and clarity, and confirm knowledge transfer to relevant teams.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Tool Selection and Environment Setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate and select the most suitable load testing tool (k6 or Artillery) based on scripting needs, CI/CD integration, reporting, and scalability. Set up the chosen tool in the target environment.
### Details:
Compare k6 and Artillery for scripting flexibility, distributed testing, dashboard integration, and ease of use. Install and configure the selected tool in the development and test environments.
<info added on 2025-08-06T14:22:52.552Z>
Tool Selection Analysis Complete: After comprehensive evaluation, selected hybrid k6 + Artillery framework. k6 chosen as primary tool for distributed load generation, advanced JavaScript scripting, and native Grafana integration. Artillery retained for rapid CI/CD integration and simple YAML-based scenario testing. Rationale based on k6's superior scripting flexibility, built-in distributed testing capabilities, and excellent metrics collection versus Artillery's YAML simplicity and existing CI/CD investment. Environment setup plan includes k6 installation for primary load testing, enhanced Artillery configuration for complementary testing, Grafana + InfluxDB integration for metrics visualization, Docker-based distributed load generation, and performance baseline establishment to meet security platform's high concurrency simulation and complex authentication flow requirements.

All scripts feature parameterized test data generation, custom security platform metrics (threat detection latency, alert correlation time), response validation with performance thresholds, realistic think time calculations based on user behavior patterns, and comprehensive error handling for invalid authentication, malformed payloads, rate limiting, and non-existent endpoints. Scripts are modular, maintainable, and ready for integration with distributed load generation infrastructure.
