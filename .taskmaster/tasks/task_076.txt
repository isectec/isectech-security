# Task ID: 76
# Title: Implement Service Mesh Security with Istio mTLS
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Deploy Istio service mesh with strict mTLS enforcement to secure all service-to-service communication as part of the Zero Trust Architecture foundation.
# Details:
1. Install Istio v1.18+ using istioctl or Helm charts
2. Configure strict mTLS mode across all namespaces
3. Create PeerAuthentication resources to enforce mTLS
4. Implement DestinationRule resources for outbound traffic policies
5. Configure AuthorizationPolicy resources for service-level access control
6. Set up Istio Gateway and VirtualService resources for ingress traffic
7. Implement certificate rotation and management
8. Configure Istio telemetry for security monitoring

Code example for strict mTLS PeerAuthentication:
```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

Use Istio 1.18+ with Envoy proxy for sidecar injection. Implement with minimal performance impact by optimizing resource requests/limits for Istio components.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify mTLS enforcement using istioctl authn tls-check command
2. Attempt plaintext communication between services to confirm rejection
3. Test certificate rotation and validate continued operation
4. Perform penetration testing to verify encryption of all service traffic
5. Monitor performance metrics to ensure minimal latency impact
6. Validate logging of all authentication events
7. Test failover scenarios and certificate expiration handling

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure Istio v1.18+ with Envoy Sidecar Injection [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Deploy Istio version 1.18 or higher on the Kubernetes cluster using istioctl or Helm charts, ensuring Envoy sidecar injection is enabled for all workloads.
### Details:
Follow official Istio installation guides to set up the control plane and enable automatic sidecar injection for all namespaces targeted for service mesh security.

Successfully implemented comprehensive Istio v1.18+ installation with Envoy sidecar injection. 

**Implementation Details:**
- Created comprehensive Istio installation configuration (istio-installation.yaml) with production-grade settings
- Configured IstioOperator with strict mTLS enforcement, resource optimization, and security context policies
- Implemented high-availability deployment with 3 replicas for istiod and ingress gateway
- Added pod anti-affinity rules to ensure distribution across nodes
- Configured extension providers for Prometheus, Jaeger, and access logging integration
- Created automated installation script (install-istio-service-mesh.sh) with comprehensive validation
- Implemented namespace preparation with automatic sidecar injection labels
- Added security contexts with non-root users and capability dropping
- Configured telemetry collection for security monitoring
- Created validation script (validate-istio-security.sh) for comprehensive security testing

**Security Enhancements:**
- Strict mTLS mode enforced globally via PeerAuthentication
- Custom CA certificate support for enterprise PKI integration  
- Resource limits and security contexts for all Istio components
- Automated certificate rotation via Istio CA
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring integration

**Files Created:**

## 2. Enable Strict mTLS Globally Across All Namespaces [done]
### Dependencies: 76.1
### Description: Configure Istio to enforce strict mutual TLS (mTLS) for all service-to-service communication within the mesh.
### Details:
Apply a PeerAuthentication resource with mTLS mode set to STRICT at the mesh or namespace level to ensure all traffic is encrypted and authenticated.

## 3. Create and Apply PeerAuthentication Resources [done]
### Dependencies: 76.2
### Description: Define and deploy PeerAuthentication resources to enforce mTLS at the desired granularity (mesh, namespace, or workload level).
### Details:
Write and apply YAML manifests for PeerAuthentication, specifying STRICT mode to guarantee mTLS enforcement for all relevant namespaces and workloads.

## 4. Implement DestinationRule Resources for Outbound Traffic Policies [done]
### Dependencies: 76.3
### Description: Create DestinationRule resources to specify TLS settings and traffic policies for outbound connections from services within the mesh.
### Details:
Define DestinationRule manifests that enforce ISTIO_MUTUAL TLS mode for all service subsets, ensuring consistent mTLS for outbound traffic.

## 5. Configure AuthorizationPolicy Resources for Service-Level Access Control [done]
### Dependencies: 76.4
### Description: Define and apply AuthorizationPolicy resources to restrict service-to-service access based on identity and other attributes.
### Details:
Write AuthorizationPolicy manifests to implement least privilege access, specifying allowed principals and actions for each service.

## 6. Set Up Istio Gateway and VirtualService Resources for Secure Ingress Traffic [done]
### Dependencies: 76.5
### Description: Deploy Istio Gateway and VirtualService resources to securely manage ingress traffic into the mesh, enforcing TLS at the edge.
### Details:
Configure Gateway resources with TLS settings and VirtualService routing rules to control and secure external access to internal services.

## 7. Implement Certificate Rotation and Management [done]
### Dependencies: 76.6
### Description: Set up automated certificate issuance, renewal, and rotation for all mTLS certificates used by Istio and Envoy sidecars.
### Details:
Leverage Istioâ€™s built-in certificate authority and Secret Discovery Service (SDS) to automate certificate lifecycle management and minimize manual intervention.

## 8. Configure Istio Telemetry for Security Monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: 76.7
### Description: Enable and customize Istio telemetry features to monitor mTLS status, policy enforcement, and detect anomalous or unauthorized traffic.
### Details:
Integrate Istio telemetry with observability tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Kiali) to collect and visualize security metrics and alerts.
