# Task ID: 53
# Title: Implement Automated Testing Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 26, 27, 28, 30
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the automated testing framework that ensures quality and reliability of the platform.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive automated testing framework with the following capabilities:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Test harnesses for all components
   - Mocking and stubbing frameworks
   - Code coverage analysis
   - Property-based testing
   - Mutation testing
   - Performance microbenchmarks

2. Integration Testing:
   - API contract testing
   - Service interaction testing
   - Database integration testing
   - External service mocking
   - Event processing validation
   - Error handling verification

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - UI automation testing
   - User journey validation
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Mobile responsiveness testing
   - Accessibility compliance testing
   - Performance and load testing

Technologies to use:
- Jest, Mocha, or JUnit for unit testing
- Cypress, Playwright, or Selenium for UI testing
- Pact or Postman for API testing
- JMeter or k6 for load testing
- Lighthouse for performance testing
- axe for accessibility testing

# Test Strategy:
1. Test coverage measurement
2. Test reliability assessment
3. Test performance optimization
4. Test environment management
5. Test data generation
6. Test reporting and visualization
7. Test automation pipeline integration
8. Test maintenance strategy

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Testing Requirements and Framework Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Gather detailed requirements for all testing types (unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, security, accessibility) and design the overall architecture of the automated testing framework tailored for iSECTECH’s platform.
### Details:
Engage stakeholders to identify testing needs, target environments, compliance constraints, and reporting requirements. Create a high-level architecture diagram covering test libraries, data management, CI/CD integration, and support tools.

## 2. Select and Configure Testing Tools and Technologies [done]
### Dependencies: 53.1
### Description: Evaluate, select, and configure the most suitable tools for each testing type, ensuring compatibility with iSECTECH’s technology stack and production requirements.
### Details:
Choose tools such as Jest/Mocha/JUnit for unit testing, Cypress/Playwright/Selenium for UI, Pact/Postman for API, JMeter/k6 for load, Lighthouse for performance, axe for accessibility, and custom tools for security. Set up toolchains, integrate with version control, and configure environments.

## 3. Develop and Implement Automated Unit and Integration Tests [done]
### Dependencies: 53.2
### Description: Create comprehensive automated unit and integration test suites for all platform components, including mocking, stubbing, code coverage, property-based, and mutation testing.
### Details:
Implement test harnesses, set up mocking/stubbing frameworks, and ensure code coverage analysis. Develop integration tests for APIs, services, databases, and external dependencies, including contract and error handling validation.

## 4. Develop and Implement End-to-End, Performance, and Accessibility Tests [done]
### Dependencies: 53.3
### Description: Build robust end-to-end test suites covering UI automation, user journeys, cross-browser/device compatibility, performance/load, and accessibility compliance.
### Details:
Automate user flows using Cypress/Playwright/Selenium, validate mobile responsiveness, and ensure accessibility with axe. Integrate Lighthouse for performance audits and JMeter/k6 for load testing. Ensure tests run in CI/CD pipelines and generate actionable reports.

## 5. Implement Custom Security Testing for Cybersecurity Platform [done]
### Dependencies: 53.4
### Description: Design and integrate automated security testing tailored to iSECTECH’s cybersecurity requirements, including vulnerability scanning, API fuzzing, and custom threat simulations.
### Details:
Develop automated tests for authentication, authorization, input validation, and business logic vulnerabilities. Integrate security scanners and custom scripts into the framework. Ensure results are actionable and integrated with reporting and alerting systems.
