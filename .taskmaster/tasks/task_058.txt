2. SSL Certificate Storage: Secure storage for private keys and certificates
3. Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting for DNS validation requests
4. Monitoring: Set up alerts for certificate expiry and DNS validation failures
5. Backup Strategy: Regular backups of domain configurations and templates

Usage Examples

Domain Configuration:
// Configure custom domain
const domain = await domainManager.configureDomain(tenantId, {
  type: 'custom-domain',
  domain: 'client.example.com',
  autoRedirect: true
}, userId);

// Validate DNS records
const validation = await domainManager.validateDnsRecords('client.example.com', tenantId);

Email Template Management:
// Create custom welcome email
const template = await emailTemplateManager.createEmailTemplate(tenantId, {
  type: 'welcome',
  name: 'Custom Welcome Email',
  subject: 'Welcome to {{companyName}}!',
  htmlContent: '<h1>Welcome {{userName}}!</h1>...',
  textContent: 'Welcome {{userName}}!...'
}, userId);

// Send test email
await emailTemplateManager.sendTestEmail(template.id, tenantId, 'test@example.com', {
  userName: 'John Doe',
  companyName: 'Acme Corp'
});

This implementation provides a solid foundation for Task 58.5 (Configuration Management UI) and subsequent white-labeling tasks. All components are production-ready with comprehensive error handling, validation, and security measures.
