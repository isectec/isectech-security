# Dependencies: 27, 28, 29
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the high-throughput event processing pipeline capable of handling 1B+ events per day with real-time analysis.
# Details:
Implement a scalable event processing pipeline with the following components:

   - Kafka 3.5+ or Pulsar 3.0+ for message queuing
   - Custom protocol for agent communication
   - API endpoints for third-party integrations
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Rate limiting and backpressure mechanisms

2. Stream Processing Layer:
   - Kafka Streams or Flink for real-time processing
   - Event enrichment with context data
   - Event correlation across sources
   - Pattern matching against known threats
   - Anomaly detection integration

3. Storage and Indexing Layer:
   - Time-series database for metrics (InfluxDB or TimescaleDB)
   - Document store for full events (Elasticsearch)
   - Data lifecycle management with tiered storage
   - Compression and partitioning strategies

4. Query and Analysis Layer:
   - Real-time dashboards
   - Historical analysis capabilities
   - Custom query language for investigations
   - Scheduled reports and alerts

Ensure the pipeline can handle 1M+ events per second with sub-second end-to-end latency for critical security events.

# Test Strategy:
1. Performance testing at scale (1M+ events/second)
2. Latency testing for end-to-end processing
3. Failure recovery testing
4. Data loss prevention testing
5. Backpressure handling testing
6. Long-running stability testing
7. Resource utilization monitoring
8. Integration testing with event producers and consumers

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Event Ingestion Layer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Architect and build the event ingestion layer using Kafka 3.5+ or Pulsar 3.0+ for message queuing, implement custom protocols for agent communication, expose API endpoints for third-party integrations, and ensure batch processing, rate limiting, and backpressure mechanisms are in place.
