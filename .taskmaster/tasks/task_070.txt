# Task ID: 70
# Title: Implement Multi-Region Deployment Architecture with Global Load Balancing and Compliance
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 36, 54, 38
# Priority: low
# Description: Design and implement a multi-region deployment architecture to support global customers, including global load balancing, regional data centers, compliance with local data regulations, and optimized international performance.
# Details:
1. Architect the platform for deployment across multiple geographic regions, leveraging GCP cloud provider services to provision independent regional environments with strict logical and physical separation between regions[3][4].
2. Implement global load balancing using DNS-based solutions (primarily GCP Cloud DNS) to direct user traffic to the nearest or healthiest regional data center, ensuring low latency and high availability[1][3][5].
3. Choose an active-active or active-passive deployment model based on workload requirements: active-active for continuous availability and load distribution, or active-passive for disaster recovery and failover[5].
4. Enforce data residency and sovereignty by ensuring that customer data is stored and processed only within the designated regional boundaries, using a strict 'share nothing' policy to prevent cross-region data leakage[3][4].
5. Integrate with the compliance automation framework to monitor and enforce local data regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, APPI), and automate evidence collection for audits[3][4].
6. Optimize application and database replication strategies for cross-region consistency, balancing performance with cost and regulatory requirements (e.g., eventual consistency for global reads, strong consistency for regional writes)[1].
7. Update CI/CD pipelines to support region-specific deployments, ensuring safe, sequential rollouts and minimizing correlated failures across regions[2].
8. Implement robust monitoring, alerting, and failover mechanisms to detect regional outages and automatically reroute traffic or promote standby regions as needed[1][3].
9. Document operational runbooks for regional failover, disaster recovery, and compliance incident response.

# Test Strategy:
1. Simulate regional outages and verify that global load balancing reroutes traffic with minimal downtime.
2. Validate that user data remains within the appropriate regional boundaries and that no cross-region data transfer occurs unless explicitly permitted.
3. Conduct compliance audits using the automation framework to ensure adherence to local data regulations in each region.
4. Measure application latency and throughput from multiple global locations to confirm performance improvements for international users.
5. Test CI/CD pipeline deployments to multiple regions, ensuring rollback and failover procedures function as intended.
6. Review monitoring and alerting systems for timely detection and response to regional failures.
7. Perform disaster recovery drills, including regional failover and data restoration, to validate operational readiness.
