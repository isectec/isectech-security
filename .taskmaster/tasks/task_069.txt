# Task ID: 69
# Title: Develop Advanced AI/ML Threat Detection Models
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 28, 34, 40
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement advanced machine learning models for enhanced threat detection, including behavioral analytics, anomaly detection, predictive threat intelligence, and automated threat hunting using modern ML frameworks.
# Details:
Leverage state-of-the-art ML frameworks (such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Scikit-learn) to build a modular suite of threat detection models. Implement behavioral analytics by establishing baselines for user and entity behavior, then use unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, autoencoders) to detect anomalies. Integrate supervised models for known threat classification and semi-supervised/unsupervised models for zero-day and unknown threat detection. Develop predictive threat intelligence models using time-series forecasting and pattern recognition to anticipate emerging threats. Incorporate automated threat hunting by designing ML-driven search algorithms that continuously scan telemetry and threat intelligence data for indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Ensure models are trained on diverse, representative datasets, and implement continuous learning pipelines for model updates. Prioritize explainability (e.g., SHAP, LIME) and operational integration with existing SIEM, SOAR, and threat intelligence systems. Follow best practices for model validation, bias mitigation, and secure model deployment.

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using labeled security datasets. 2. Perform adversarial testing with simulated attack scenarios to assess detection robustness. 3. Measure false positive and false negative rates in both lab and production-like environments. 4. Conduct performance and scalability testing under realistic data loads. 5. Test integration with SIEM, SOAR, and threat intelligence ingestion pipelines. 6. Evaluate explainability outputs for security analyst usability. 7. Review model retraining and update workflows for reliability and security. 8. Monitor for model drift and degradation over time, implementing automated alerts for retraining triggers.
