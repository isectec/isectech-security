# Task ID: 36
# Title: Implement Compliance Automation Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 27, 29, 32
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the compliance automation framework that supports multiple regulatory frameworks and provides continuous compliance monitoring.
# Details:
Implement a flexible compliance automation framework with the following features:

1. Compliance Framework Support:
   - SOC 2 Type II
   - ISO 27001
   - GDPR/Privacy regulations
   - Industry-specific frameworks (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, CMMC, FERPA)
   - Custom compliance frameworks

2. Compliance Assessment:
   - Control mapping across frameworks
   - Automated evidence collection
   - Continuous control monitoring
   - Gap analysis and remediation tracking
   - Risk assessment integration

3. Compliance Reporting:
   - Executive dashboards
   - Detailed compliance reports
   - Evidence packages for audits
   - Historical compliance trending
   - Audit trail for compliance activities

Technologies to use:
- OSCAL for compliance as code
- OpenControl for compliance documentation
- Policy-as-code with OPA
- Automated evidence collection agents
- Digital signature for evidence integrity

# Test Strategy:
1. Framework mapping accuracy validation
2. Evidence collection completeness testing
3. Control effectiveness assessment
4. Report generation accuracy
5. Multi-framework support testing
6. Compliance workflow validation
7. Audit preparation functionality testing
8. Historical tracking and trending validation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Conduct Multi-Framework Compliance Requirements Analysis [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform a comprehensive analysis of SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, CMMC, FERPA, and any custom frameworks to identify all applicable controls, regulatory requirements, and iSECTECH-specific obligations.
### Details:
Gather and document all relevant regulatory requirements and map them to iSECTECH's business processes and cybersecurity platform architecture. Identify overlaps, unique requirements, and areas requiring custom controls.

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:** Built ComplianceRequirementsAnalyzer in /compliance-automation/requirements/multi-framework-analysis.ts. Supports 8 frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS v4.0, CMMC 2.0, FERPA, iSECTECH Custom) with 25+ detailed controls, cross-framework mapping, gap analysis with severity assessment, and automation opportunity identification. Production-ready with TypeScript/Zod validation and comprehensive error handling.

## 2. Design and Implement Control Mapping and Policy-as-Code Infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Develop a unified control mapping layer that aligns controls across all supported frameworks and implement policy-as-code using OPA and OSCAL for automated enforcement and documentation.
### Details:
Create a control matrix that maps requirements across frameworks. Implement policy-as-code modules for each mapped control using OPA, and document controls in OSCAL/OpenControl for traceability and audit readiness.

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:** Built unified control mapping engine at /compliance-automation/policies/ with 4 comprehensive control mappings (IAM, Monitoring, Data Protection, Vulnerability Management). Implemented OPAPolicyEngine with policy deployment/evaluation capabilities and OSCALGenerator for complete OSCAL documentation suite. All components support cross-framework alignment and automated policy enforcement.

## 3. Integrate Automated Evidence Collection and Continuous Monitoring Agents [done]
### Dependencies: 36.2
### Description: Deploy and configure automated agents to collect evidence for mapped controls and enable continuous monitoring across iSECTECH's infrastructure, ensuring digital signatures for evidence integrity.
### Details:
Integrate evidence collection agents with key systems (cloud, endpoints, network, applications). Ensure all evidence is cryptographically signed and stored securely for audit purposes. Enable real-time monitoring and alerting for control deviations.

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:** Implemented EvidenceCollectionEngine at /compliance-automation/evidence/ with 4 monitoring agent types (AWS, Kubernetes, System, Application). Features automated evidence collection with digital signature verification, real-time monitoring with alerting, and secure evidence storage. Production-ready with comprehensive error handling and multi-tenant support.

## 4. Implement Gap Analysis, Remediation Tracking, and Risk Assessment Automation [done]
### Dependencies: 36.3
### Description: Automate gap analysis against framework requirements, track remediation activities, and integrate risk assessment workflows to prioritize compliance risks and actions.
### Details:
Develop automated routines to compare current control status with framework requirements, generate remediation tickets, and link findings to risk assessment modules for prioritization and tracking.

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:** Built integrated assessment system at /compliance-automation/assessment/ with automated gap analysis engine, comprehensive remediation tracking with SLA monitoring, and advanced risk assessment automation using Monte Carlo simulations. Created IntegratedAssessmentSystem for unified workflow orchestration. All components production-ready with TypeScript validation and comprehensive error handling.

## 5. Develop Compliance Reporting, Audit Preparation, and Executive Dashboards [done]
### Dependencies: 36.4
### Description: Build comprehensive reporting capabilities, including executive dashboards, detailed compliance reports, evidence packages, historical trending, and audit trails to support internal and external audits.
### Details:
Implement automated report generation for each supported framework, provide customizable dashboards for stakeholders, and ensure all compliance activities are logged for auditability. Prepare exportable evidence packages for auditors.

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:** Built comprehensive reporting system at /compliance-automation/reporting/ with ComplianceDashboardSystem (5 dashboard types, 10+ widget types), AuditPreparationEngine (evidence compilation, control testing, readiness assessment), and ComprehensiveReportingSystem (executive dashboards, regulatory reports, trend analysis, cost-benefit analysis). All components production-ready with multi-format output support and audit trail capabilities.
