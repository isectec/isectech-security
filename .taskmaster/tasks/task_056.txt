# Task ID: 56
# Title: Implement Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 26, 27, 29, 54, 55
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities that ensure the platform can recover from failures and continue operations.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities with the following features:

1. Backup and Recovery:
   - Automated backup scheduling
   - Multi-region data replication
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - Backup verification and testing
   - Secure backup storage
   - Recovery automation

2. High Availability:
   - Multi-zone deployment
   - Multi-region failover
   - Load balancing and auto-scaling
   - Database clustering and replication
   - Cache replication and failover
   - Service mesh for resilience

3. Business Continuity:
   - Recovery time objective (RTO) monitoring
   - Recovery point objective (RPO) monitoring
   - Disaster recovery runbooks
   - Regular DR testing
   - Incident management procedures
   - Communication plans

Technologies to use:
- Cloud provider backup services
- Database-specific backup tools
- Velero for Kubernetes backup
- Multi-region infrastructure with Terraform
- Chaos engineering tools like Chaos Monkey
- DR testing automation

# Test Strategy:
1. Backup and restore testing
2. Failover testing between zones
3. Failover testing between regions
4. Data consistency verification
5. RTO and RPO measurement
6. Chaos engineering experiments
7. DR runbook validation
8. Communication plan testing

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Automated Backup and Recovery Systems [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish automated, secure, and verifiable backup and recovery processes for all critical data and systems, including multi-region replication, point-in-time recovery, and backup integrity testing tailored for iSECTECHâ€™s cybersecurity platform.
### Details:
Configure cloud provider and database-specific backup tools for automated scheduling, multi-region replication, and secure storage. Integrate Velero for Kubernetes backup. Implement automated backup verification and regular restore testing to ensure recoverability. Document backup and recovery procedures.

## 2. Establish High Availability and Multi-Region Failover Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: 56.1
### Description: Deploy production infrastructure across multiple zones and regions with automated failover, load balancing, and resilient database and cache replication to ensure continuous platform availability.
### Details:
Use Terraform to provision multi-zone and multi-region infrastructure. Implement load balancers, auto-scaling groups, database clustering, and cache replication. Integrate service mesh for resilient service-to-service communication. Document failover and recovery workflows.

## 3. Define and Monitor RTO/RPO Metrics for Critical Services [done]
### Dependencies: 56.1, 56.2
### Description: Establish, document, and continuously monitor Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for all mission-critical systems, ensuring alignment with business requirements and regulatory standards.
### Details:
Perform business impact analysis to determine acceptable RTO/RPO for each service. Implement monitoring and alerting for RTO/RPO breaches. Integrate metrics into dashboards for real-time visibility and reporting.

## 4. Develop and Automate Disaster Recovery Testing and Runbooks [done]
### Dependencies: 56.1, 56.2, 56.3
### Description: Create, document, and automate disaster recovery (DR) runbooks and regular DR testing procedures to validate end-to-end recovery capabilities and ensure operational readiness.
### Details:
Draft detailed DR runbooks covering various failure scenarios. Automate DR test execution using CI/CD and DR testing tools. Schedule and document regular DR drills, including validation of communication and escalation procedures.

## 5. Integrate Chaos Engineering for Resilience Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 56.2, 56.3, 56.4
### Description: Implement chaos engineering practices using tools like Chaos Monkey to proactively test platform resilience, identify weaknesses, and validate the effectiveness of disaster recovery and business continuity strategies.
### Details:
Deploy chaos engineering tools in production-like environments to simulate failures (e.g., node outages, network partitions). Analyze system behavior, document findings, and refine DR/BC strategies based on results.
