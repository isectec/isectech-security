# Task ID: 40
# Title: Implement Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 27, 29, 33
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the SIEM component that provides log collection, correlation, and analysis capabilities.
# Details:
Implement a modern SIEM solution with the following capabilities:

1. Log Collection:
   - Agent-based collection from endpoints
   - Agentless collection from network devices
   - Cloud service log integration
   - Syslog receiver for legacy systems
   - Custom log format support
   - Log integrity verification

2. Log Processing:
   - Parsing and normalization
   - Enrichment with context data
   - Correlation across sources
   - Machine learning for anomaly detection
   - Real-time alerting
   - Long-term storage and archiving

3. Analysis and Investigation:
   - Search and query capabilities
   - Visual investigation tools
   - Threat hunting workflows
   - Case management integration
   - Compliance reporting
   - Forensic timeline reconstruction

Technologies to use:
- Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK) stack
- OpenSearch as an alternative to Elasticsearch
- Vector or Fluentd for log collection
- Sigma rules for detection
- MITRE ATT&CK for threat mapping
- Lucene query language for searches

# Test Strategy:
1. Log collection reliability testing
2. Parsing accuracy validation
3. Correlation rule effectiveness testing
4. Search performance testing
5. Storage efficiency measurement
6. Retention policy enforcement testing
7. Alert generation timeliness testing
8. Investigation workflow validation

Create detailed diagrams and documentation for log ingestion, processing, storage, and access patterns.

## 4. Implement Agent-Based Log Collection [done]
### Dependencies: 40.3
### Description: Deploy and configure agents on endpoints to collect and forward logs to the SIEM.
### Details:
Select appropriate agents, automate deployment, and ensure secure transmission of logs.

## 5. Implement Agentless and Network Device Log Collection [done]
### Dependencies: 40.3
### Description: Configure agentless collection for network devices and integrate syslog receivers for legacy systems.
### Details:
Set up SNMP, syslog, and other protocols for agentless collection; validate connectivity and data flow.

## 6. Integrate Cloud Service Logs [done]
### Dependencies: 40.3
### Description: Establish secure log ingestion from cloud services (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor) into the SIEM.
### Details:
Configure cloud connectors or APIs, map log formats, and ensure compliance with cloud provider policies.

## 7. Support Custom Log Formats and Log Integrity [done]
### Dependencies: 40.4, 40.5, 40.6
### Description: Enable ingestion of custom log formats and implement log integrity verification mechanisms.
### Details:
Develop parsers for custom formats and apply cryptographic integrity checks on log data.

## 8. Implement Log Parsing and Normalization [done]
### Dependencies: 40.7
### Description: Configure parsing rules and normalization pipelines to standardize log data across all sources.
### Details:
Use Logstash, Fluentd, or Vector to parse, normalize, and enrich logs for downstream analysis.

## 9. Enrich Logs with Contextual Data [done]
### Dependencies: 40.8
### Description: Integrate external context sources (e.g., asset inventory, threat intelligence) to enrich log events.
### Details:
Map enrichment fields and automate context data updates for correlation and analysis.

## 10. Develop Correlation and Detection Rules [done]
### Dependencies: 40.9
### Description: Implement correlation logic and detection rules using Sigma and MITRE ATT&CK mappings.
