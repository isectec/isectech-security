# Subtasks:
## 1. Current Gateway Capability Assessment [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate the existing API gateway's features, configurations, and limitations regarding rate limiting, security, traffic management, and failover.
### Details:
Review documentation, configuration files, and operational metrics of the existing Kong setup to establish a baseline of current capabilities and identify gaps. Analyze the current Kong configuration for extensibility and integration points.
<info added on 2025-08-06T14:34:50.456Z>
Comprehensive assessment completed with detailed analysis of Kong Gateway infrastructure revealing robust existing capabilities and clear enhancement priorities. Current production setup includes 7 configured services with advanced token bucket rate limiting, multi-layered security (OAuth 2.1, JWT, mTLS), circuit breakers, and health checks. Key strengths identified: hierarchical rate limiting policies, service-specific circuit breaker configurations, comprehensive security stack, and multi-region upstreams. Critical gaps requiring enhancement: L7 DDoS protection with baseline profiling, proper leaky bucket throttling implementation, Redis-distributed token bucket algorithms, A/B testing capabilities, intelligent regional failover, and real-time monitoring dashboards. Architecture assessment confirms Kong as primary gateway layer with Redis caching, PostgreSQL persistence, and emergency admin security already implemented. Recommended implementation priority established for remaining subtasks focusing on enhanced DDoS protection, leaky bucket implementation, advanced traffic management, and comprehensive monitoring setup.

Infrastructure assessment completed revealing solid foundation with Kong Gateway providing basic token bucket implementation, hierarchical rate limiting policies across global/tenant/API levels, Redis-backed distributed tracking, and preliminary anomaly detection capabilities. Key findings include existing rate limiting middleware with configurable policies, Redis cluster for distributed state management, basic monitoring through Kong Admin API, and foundational DDoS detection rules. Critical gaps identified requiring immediate attention: incomplete token bucket algorithm lacking proper refill mechanics and burst handling, missing leaky bucket integration for smooth traffic shaping, insufficient DDoS baseline profiling and adaptive thresholds, limited monitoring dashboards with basic Kong metrics only, and lack of advanced client feedback mechanisms. Next phase will focus on implementing hybrid token bucket/leaky bucket algorithm, enhanced DDoS protection with behavioral analysis, comprehensive monitoring dashboards, and adaptive rate limiting based on real-time traffic patterns and server health metrics.
