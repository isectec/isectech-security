# Task ID: 72
# Title: Develop Executive Analytics Dashboards for Security Leadership
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 46, 36, 42, 69
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement advanced executive dashboards that deliver actionable security KPIs, threat landscape analytics, compliance reporting, ROI metrics, and strategic insights tailored for C-level decision makers.
# Details:
Leverage the existing reporting and analytics engine to build modular, action-centric dashboards optimized for executive use. Implement using React/Next.js frontend with D3.js visualization, Node.js/GraphQL backend, PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB for time-series analytics, and Redis caching for sub-5-second dashboard performance. Prioritize critical security insights—such as real-time threat indices, compliance status, and risk trends—using clear, hierarchical visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, KPI widgets, trend lines). Integrate data from threat detection models, compliance automation, and posture management to provide a unified view. Ensure dashboards are customizable to executive roles and objectives, with single-click drill-down capabilities for deeper analysis. Implement robust data privacy and security controls: encrypt all dashboard data in transit and at rest, enforce RBAC, SSO, and MFA, and ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations. Provide predictive analytics and actionable recommendations, enabling executives to make informed, strategic decisions. Design for mobile-first experience supporting executive usage patterns with <5-second load times, <5-minute data latency, and 99.9% uptime with executive priority support.

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate accuracy and timeliness of all displayed KPIs, analytics, and compliance metrics using test datasets and simulated security events. 2. Conduct usability testing with executive stakeholders to ensure clarity, relevance, and actionable insight delivery. 3. Perform security testing: verify encryption, RBAC, SSO, and MFA enforcement, and test for unauthorized data access. 4. Test dashboard scalability and performance under high data loads, ensuring <5-second load times for executive users. 5. Confirm integration with threat detection, compliance, and posture management systems. 6. Validate export, drill-down, and customization features. 7. Review for regulatory compliance (GDPR, CCPA) and data anonymization where required. 8. Conduct executive user acceptance testing with C-level stakeholders. 9. Perform penetration testing focused on executive data protection.
