# Task ID: 79
# Title: Implement Policy Decision Points for Access Control
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 78
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop policy decision points that evaluate trust scores and context for every access request, enforcing zero trust principles across the platform.
# Details:
1. Design policy decision architecture using Open Policy Agent (OPA) v0.55+
2. Implement policy rules in Rego language for access decisions
3. Integrate with trust score calculation system
4. Create policy evaluation API endpoints
5. Implement caching for policy decisions using Redis
6. Set up comprehensive logging for all policy decisions
7. Develop policy management interface for administrators
8. Configure integration with Kubernetes admission controllers

Example Rego policy:
```rego
package authz

default allow = false

allow {
    # Get trust score from trust score service
    trust_score := get_trust_score(input.user, input.device, input.context)
    
    # Check if trust score meets minimum threshold for requested resource
    resource_threshold := data.resource_thresholds[input.resource]
    trust_score >= resource_threshold
    
    # Check if user has required permissions
    has_permission(input.user, input.resource, input.action)
}

has_permission(user, resource, action) {
    # Check RBAC permissions
    permission := data.permissions[user][resource][action]
    permission == true
}
```

Implement using OPA 0.55+, integrated with Envoy proxy for API gateway enforcement and Kubernetes for admission control.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test policy decisions with various trust scores and contexts
2. Verify correct policy application for different resources
3. Test performance under high load (1000+ decisions per second)
4. Validate integration with authentication systems
5. Test policy updates and propagation
6. Verify audit logging of all policy decisions
7. Test failure modes and fallback policies
