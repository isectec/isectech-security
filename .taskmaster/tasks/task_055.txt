# Task ID: 55
# Title: Implement Monitoring and Observability
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 26, 27, 28, 54
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the monitoring and observability system that provides visibility into the platform's health and performance.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive monitoring and observability system with the following capabilities:

1. Infrastructure Monitoring:
   - Server health and performance
   - Container monitoring
   - Network performance
   - Database performance
   - Storage utilization
   - Cloud resource monitoring

2. Application Monitoring:
   - Service health checks
   - API performance metrics
   - Error tracking and aggregation
   - Distributed tracing
   - User experience monitoring
   - Business transaction monitoring

3. Alerting and Response:
   - Alert definition and management
   - Alert routing and escalation
   - On-call rotation management
   - Incident response automation
   - Post-mortem analysis
   - SLA tracking and reporting

Technologies to use:
- Prometheus and Grafana for metrics
- Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK) for logging
- Jaeger or Zipkin for distributed tracing
- OpenTelemetry for instrumentation
- PagerDuty or OpsGenie for alerting
- Sentry for error tracking

# Test Strategy:
1. Monitoring coverage validation
2. Alert accuracy verification
3. Performance impact assessment
4. Scalability testing for high volume
5. Integration testing with alerting systems
6. Dashboard accuracy verification
7. Incident response workflow testing
8. SLA calculation validation
