# Task ID: 68
# Title: Implement Automated Customer Onboarding Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 38, 52, 58
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop an automated onboarding workflow for new enterprise customers, including account setup, initial configuration, delivery of training resources, and guided setup wizards for the iSECTECH platform.
# Details:
Design and implement a modular, automated onboarding workflow that orchestrates the following steps: (1) automated account provisioning and initial configuration based on customer profile and selected services; (2) integration with the customer success portal to deliver tailored training resources and documentation; (3) guided setup wizards with in-app walkthroughs and contextual help for key platform features; (4) automated delivery of welcome communications and onboarding checklists via email and in-app notifications; (5) collection of customer data and preferences through dynamic forms; (6) integration with compliance and multi-tenant frameworks to ensure regulatory and tenant-specific requirements are met during onboarding. Use a workflow automation engine (e.g., Camunda, Temporal, or a cloud-native alternative) to manage state, triggers, and conditional logic. Ensure extensibility for future onboarding steps and support for white-labeling. Follow best practices by mapping the customer journey, identifying automation opportunities, and involving stakeholders from product, compliance, and customer success. Prioritize seamless integration with existing systems (CRM, support, analytics) and provide robust analytics for tracking onboarding progress and identifying drop-off points. Implement secure handling of customer data and ensure accessibility and localization support in all onboarding interfaces. Refer to the comprehensive documentation in `.taskmaster/docs/task-68-agent-instructions.md`, `.taskmaster/docs/task-68-technical-architecture.md`, and `.taskmaster/docs/task-68-integration-guide.md` for detailed implementation specifications, technical architecture, and integration requirements.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit and integration testing of each onboarding workflow step (account setup, configuration, resource delivery, guided wizards). 2. End-to-end testing of the full onboarding flow for multiple customer personas and tenant types. 3. Validation of automated triggers, conditional logic, and error handling. 4. Usability testing of guided setup wizards and onboarding UI with real users. 5. Verification of integration with the customer success portal, compliance automation, and multi-tenant architecture. 6. Testing of onboarding analytics and reporting dashboards. 7. Security and privacy testing for customer data handling. 8. Accessibility and localization validation. 9. Pilot rollout with select customers and collection of feedback for iterative improvement. 10. Follow the testing framework specifications outlined in the technical architecture documentation.
