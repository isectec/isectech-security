# Task ID: 34
# Title: Implement Threat Intelligence Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 27, 28, 33
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the system for ingesting, processing, and utilizing threat intelligence from multiple sources to enhance detection capabilities.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive threat intelligence system with the following components:

1. Intelligence Source Integration:
   - Commercial feeds (e.g., Recorded Future, Digital Shadows)
   - Open-source feeds (e.g., AlienVault OTX, MISP)
   - Government sources (e.g., US-CERT, CISA)
   - Industry-specific ISACs
   - Internal intelligence generation

2. Intelligence Processing:
   - Indicator extraction and normalization
   - Deduplication and correlation
   - Confidence scoring and prioritization
   - Contextual enrichment
   - TTPs mapping to MITRE ATT&CK framework

3. Intelligence Utilization:
   - Real-time matching against events
   - Proactive hunting based on intelligence
   - Retrospective analysis of historical data
   - Automated blocking of known threats
   - Intelligence sharing with the community

Technologies to use:
- STIX 2.1 and TAXII 2.1 for standardized intelligence representation
- OpenCTI for intelligence management
- MISP for community intelligence sharing
- YARA rules for pattern matching
- Sigma rules for detection logic

# Test Strategy:
1. Feed ingestion reliability testing
2. Intelligence quality assessment
3. False positive rate measurement
4. Detection time improvement metrics
5. Coverage analysis against MITRE ATT&CK
6. Performance impact of intelligence matching
7. Intelligence sharing functionality testing
8. Intelligence lifecycle management testing

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Commercial Threat Intelligence Feeds [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish automated ingestion pipelines for commercial threat intelligence sources such as Recorded Future and Digital Shadows, ensuring secure connectivity and data normalization.
### Details:
Configure connectors or APIs for each commercial feed, map incoming data to STIX 2.1 format, and ensure licensing compliance. Validate data freshness and completeness.

## 2. Integrate Open-Source and Government Threat Feeds [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up ingestion and normalization for open-source (e.g., AlienVault OTX, MISP) and government (e.g., US-CERT, CISA) threat intelligence feeds, including support for TAXII 2.1.
### Details:
Implement TAXII 2.1 clients and connectors for open-source and government feeds. Normalize all data to STIX 2.1 and ensure deduplication across sources.

## 3. Integrate Internal and Industry-Specific Intelligence [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enable ingestion and processing of internally generated intelligence and industry-specific ISAC feeds, supporting custom formats and enrichment.
### Details:
Develop parsers for internal threat data and ISAC feeds. Map custom indicators to STIX 2.1 and enrich with contextual metadata.

## 4. Implement Indicator Extraction, Normalization, and Correlation [done]
### Dependencies: 34.1, 34.2, 34.3
### Description: Develop processing logic to extract, normalize, deduplicate, and correlate indicators from all integrated sources, including mapping to MITRE ATT&CK TTPs.
### Details:
Use OpenCTI and MISP for indicator management. Apply normalization rules, deduplication algorithms, and correlation logic. Map indicators to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

## 5. Score, Prioritize, and Enrich Threat Intelligence [done]
### Dependencies: 34.4
### Description: Implement confidence scoring, prioritization, and contextual enrichment for all processed intelligence to support effective decision-making.
### Details:
Apply scoring models based on source reliability, indicator type, and historical context. Enrich indicators with additional context from internal and external sources.

## 6. Enable Real-Time and Retrospective Intelligence Utilization [done]
### Dependencies: 34.5
### Description: Integrate processed intelligence into detection workflows for real-time event matching, proactive threat hunting, and retrospective analysis using YARA and Sigma rules.
### Details:
Configure SIEM/SOAR integrations for real-time matching. Implement hunting playbooks and retrospective queries. Use YARA and Sigma rules for pattern-based detection.

## 7. Automate Threat Response and Intelligence Sharing [done]
### Dependencies: 34.6
### Description: Develop automation for blocking known threats and sharing intelligence with the community via MISP and TAXII, ensuring compliance and operational efficiency.
### Details:
Implement automated response actions (e.g., blocking IPs, domains) and configure MISP/TAXII for outbound intelligence sharing. Ensure auditability and compliance.
