# Task ID: 77
# Title: Implement Identity-Based Network Policies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 76
# Priority: high
# Description: Deploy Kubernetes Network Policies with identity context to enforce microsegmentation and zero trust principles at the pod and service level.
# Details:
1. Design network policy architecture based on service identity
2. Implement default-deny policies for all namespaces
3. Create granular allow policies based on service identity and namespace
4. Integrate with Istio for identity-aware network policies
5. Configure Calico (v3.25+) or Cilium (v1.13+) for enhanced network policy capabilities
6. Implement egress network policies to control outbound traffic
7. Set up monitoring and alerting for network policy violations

Example network policy:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-all
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```

For identity-based policies with Cilium:
```yaml
apiVersion: cilium.io/v2
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: service-to-service
  namespace: production
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  ingress:
  - fromEndpoints:
    - matchLabels:
        app: api-gateway
        io.kubernetes.pod.namespace: production
```

Implement with Cilium 1.13+ for identity-aware policies or Calico 3.25+ with WireGuard encryption.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify policy enforcement by attempting unauthorized connections
2. Test cross-namespace communication restrictions
3. Validate identity-based access controls using different service accounts
4. Monitor network policy logs for denied connections
5. Perform penetration testing to verify microsegmentation effectiveness
6. Test policy updates and changes to ensure proper propagation
7. Validate integration with service mesh identity

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Identity-Based Network Policy Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the architecture for Kubernetes network policies that leverage pod and service identity, ensuring microsegmentation and zero trust principles are enforced at both pod and service levels.
### Details:
Identify service identities, namespace boundaries, and required communication flows. Document policy requirements for each service and namespace, specifying which identities are allowed to communicate.

## 2. Implement Default-Deny Policies Across All Namespaces [pending]
### Dependencies: 77.1
### Description: Deploy default-deny ingress and egress network policies in every namespace to block all traffic by default, ensuring only explicitly allowed traffic is permitted.
### Details:
Create and apply default-deny NetworkPolicy YAMLs for each namespace using kubectl, ensuring no pod can communicate unless explicitly allowed.

## 3. Create Granular Allow Policies Based on Service Identity [pending]
### Dependencies: 77.2
### Description: Develop and apply fine-grained allow policies that permit traffic only between specific services or pods based on their identity and namespace.
### Details:
Define NetworkPolicy or CiliumNetworkPolicy resources that use label selectors and namespace selectors to allow only required service-to-service or pod-to-pod communication.

## 4. Integrate Istio for Identity-Aware Network Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 77.3
### Description: Configure Istio to enforce identity-aware network policies, leveraging Istio's service identity and authorization policies for enhanced security.
### Details:
Deploy Istio and configure AuthorizationPolicies and PeerAuthentication resources to enforce identity-based access controls at the service mesh layer.

## 5. Configure Calico or Cilium for Enhanced Policy Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 77.4
### Description: Set up Calico (v3.25+) or Cilium (v1.13+) as the CNI plugin to enable advanced identity-based network policy features and encryption.
### Details:
Install and configure the chosen CNI plugin, enable features such as WireGuard encryption (for Calico), and apply identity-aware policies using plugin-specific CRDs.

## 6. Implement Egress Policies and Monitoring for Policy Violations [pending]
### Dependencies: 77.5
### Description: Deploy egress network policies to control outbound traffic and set up monitoring and alerting for network policy violations.
### Details:
Define and apply egress policies restricting outbound connections, and integrate monitoring tools or CNI plugin features to detect and alert on policy violations.
