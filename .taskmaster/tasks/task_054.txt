# Task ID: 54
# Title: Implement CI/CD Pipeline
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 26, 27, 28, 53
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment process.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with the following capabilities:

1. Continuous Integration:
   - Source code management with Git
   - Automated builds for all components
   - Unit and integration testing
   - Static code analysis
   - Security scanning
   - Dependency vulnerability checking
   - Code quality metrics

2. Continuous Delivery:
   - Environment promotion workflow
   - Infrastructure as Code deployment
   - Database schema migration
   - Feature flag management
   - Canary deployments
   - Blue/green deployments
   - Rollback capabilities

3. Pipeline Management:
   - Pipeline visualization
   - Approval workflows
   - Deployment scheduling
   - Audit logging
   - Metrics and analytics
   - Notification system

Technologies to use:
- GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins for pipeline orchestration
- Docker and Kubernetes for containerization
- Terraform or Pulumi for infrastructure as code
- SonarQube for code quality
- OWASP Dependency Check for vulnerability scanning
- ArgoCD or Flux for GitOps
- LaunchDarkly or Split.io for feature flags

# Test Strategy:
1. Pipeline reliability testing
2. Deployment success rate measurement
3. Rollback effectiveness testing
4. Performance impact of pipeline
5. Security scanning validation
6. Environment consistency verification
7. Feature flag functionality testing
8. Notification system validation
