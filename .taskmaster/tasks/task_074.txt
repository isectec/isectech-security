# Task ID: 74
# Title: Conduct Comprehensive Security Penetration Testing for iSECTECH Platform
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 65, 53
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform a full-scope penetration test of the iSECTECH platform, including API, authentication, injection, privilege escalation, and infrastructure security, following industry-standard methodologies. Document all vulnerabilities and coordinate remediation efforts.
# Details:
1. Scope Definition: Define the scope of testing to include all platform componentsâ€”web applications, APIs, authentication mechanisms, backend infrastructure, and cloud environments. Coordinate with stakeholders to ensure coverage and minimize operational impact.

2. Methodology Selection: Adopt industry-recognized penetration testing methodologies such as OSSTMM, OWASP Testing Guide, and PTES to ensure comprehensive and systematic coverage[1][2][4][5].

3. Reconnaissance & Attack Surface Mapping: Use automated and manual tools (e.g., Pentest-Tools.com, Nmap, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP) to enumerate assets, endpoints, and exposed services, including subdomains, APIs, and cloud resources[3].

4. Vulnerability Assessment: Perform authenticated and unauthenticated scans for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10, SANS Top 25), including injection flaws, broken authentication, misconfigurations, and insecure direct object references. Include API-specific tests for improper input validation, authorization bypass, and rate limiting.

5. Exploitation: Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to validate risk, including authentication bypass, privilege escalation, injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, command injection), and lateral movement within infrastructure. Use both automated and manual techniques.

6. Infrastructure Security Assessment: Assess cloud and on-premises infrastructure for misconfigurations, weak IAM policies, exposed management interfaces, and network segmentation flaws. Leverage existing monitoring and logging infrastructure (from Task 65) to detect and correlate attack attempts.

7. Documentation & Reporting: Document all findings with technical details, risk ratings, and evidence (screenshots, logs, exploit traces). Provide actionable remediation guidance for each vulnerability. Generate an executive summary and a technical report for stakeholders.

8. Remediation & Retesting: Collaborate with engineering teams to prioritize and implement fixes. Retest remediated vulnerabilities to confirm closure.

9. Continuous Improvement: Integrate lessons learned into security policies, monitoring, and future development practices. Recommend periodic retesting and integration with automated security testing pipelines.

Best practices: Use a mix of commercial and open-source tools, ensure tests are performed in a controlled environment, and maintain strict confidentiality and data protection throughout the process.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that penetration testing covers all in-scope components (web, API, authentication, infrastructure).
2. Confirm that all major vulnerability classes (OWASP Top 10, SANS Top 25) are tested, including authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios.
3. Validate that findings are documented with sufficient detail for remediation, including risk ratings and evidence.
4. Ensure that all critical and high-risk vulnerabilities are remediated and retested for closure.
5. Review that the final report includes an executive summary, technical details, and actionable recommendations.
6. Confirm that lessons learned are communicated to relevant teams and integrated into security processes.
7. Optionally, conduct a follow-up assessment to verify ongoing security posture improvements.
