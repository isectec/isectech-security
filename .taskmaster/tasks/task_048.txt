# Task ID: 48
# Title: Implement Integration Framework for Third-Party Tools
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 27, 39
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the integration framework that enables connections with 200+ enterprise tools and services.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive integration framework with the following capabilities:

1. Pre-built Integrations:
   - Security tool integrations (90+)
   - Cloud platform integrations (50+)
   - IT operations integrations (60+)
   - Custom integration capability

2. Integration Architecture:
   - Webhook receivers for inbound data
   - API clients for outbound actions
   - Data transformation and normalization
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting and throttling
   - Error handling and retry logic

3. Integration Management:
   - Integration marketplace
   - Visual configuration interface
   - Testing and validation tools
   - Monitoring and troubleshooting
   - Version management
   - Documentation generation

Technologies to use:
- OpenAPI for API specifications
- Swagger for API documentation
- OAuth 2.0 for authentication
- Webhook standardization
- Integration testing framework
- Circuit breakers for resilience

# Test Strategy:
1. Integration functionality testing
2. Authentication mechanism validation
3. Error handling and recovery testing
4. Performance impact assessment
5. Data transformation accuracy verification
6. Rate limiting and throttling testing
7. Version compatibility testing
8. Documentation accuracy verification

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Integration Architecture and Core Framework [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement the foundational architecture for the integration framework, including webhook receivers, API clients, data transformation and normalization, authentication and authorization (OAuth 2.0), rate limiting, error handling, and resilience mechanisms.
### Details:
Establish the core integration architecture using OpenAPI for API specifications, Swagger for documentation, and standardized webhook handling. Implement authentication and authorization flows, rate limiting, error handling, and circuit breakers for resilience.

## 2. Develop Pre-built Integrations for Enterprise Tools [done]
### Dependencies: 48.1
### Description: Implement and maintain pre-built integrations for 200+ enterprise tools, including security, cloud, and IT operations platforms, ensuring coverage and compatibility.
### Details:
Build and document integrations for at least 90 security tools, 50 cloud platforms, and 60 IT operations tools. Ensure each integration adheres to the frameworkâ€™s standards for connectivity, data normalization, and security.

## 3. Enable Custom Integration Capability [done]
### Dependencies: 48.1
### Description: Provide mechanisms and tooling for users to create, configure, and manage custom integrations with third-party tools not covered by pre-built connectors.
### Details:
Develop APIs, SDKs, and configuration interfaces that allow users to define custom integrations, including mapping, transformation, and authentication logic. Ensure extensibility and security.

## 4. Implement Integration Management and Marketplace [done]
### Dependencies: 48.2, 48.3
### Description: Develop an integration management layer, including a marketplace, visual configuration interface, testing and validation tools, monitoring, troubleshooting, version management, and automated documentation generation.
### Details:
Create a user-facing marketplace for available integrations, provide visual tools for configuration and testing, implement monitoring and troubleshooting dashboards, and automate documentation updates using Swagger/OpenAPI.

## 5. Establish Governance, Security, and Compliance Controls [done]
### Dependencies: 48.1, 48.4
### Description: Define and enforce governance, security, and compliance policies for all integrations, including access controls, audit logging, and adherence to organizational and regulatory standards.
### Details:
Implement centralized governance for integration lifecycle, enforce authentication and authorization policies, enable audit trails, and ensure compliance with relevant standards (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2).
