# Task ID: 57
# Title: Implement Data Migration Tools
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 27, 29, 33, 48
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the data migration tools that enable customers to migrate from existing security tools to the platform.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive data migration tools with the following capabilities:

1. Source System Connectors:
   - SIEM system connectors (Splunk, QRadar, etc.)
   - Endpoint protection connectors (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, etc.)
   - Vulnerability management connectors (Tenable, Qualys, etc.)
   - Custom data source connectors

2. Migration Process:
   - Data assessment and planning
   - Schema mapping and transformation
   - Incremental migration support
   - Validation and verification
   - Rollback capabilities
   - Progress monitoring and reporting

3. Post-Migration Support:
   - Data reconciliation
   - Historical data access
   - Performance optimization
   - Training and documentation
   - Migration success metrics
   - Legacy system decommissioning

Technologies to use:
- ETL frameworks for data transformation
- API clients for source systems
- Validation frameworks for data integrity
- Parallel processing for large datasets
- Checkpointing for resumable migrations
- Data quality assessment tools

# Test Strategy:
1. Connector functionality testing
2. Data transformation accuracy verification
3. Performance testing with large datasets
4. Incremental migration testing
5. Rollback functionality validation
6. Error handling and recovery testing
7. End-to-end migration workflow testing
8. Data integrity verification
