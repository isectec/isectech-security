## Overview

This document establishes emergency response procedures for the iSECTECH Security Platform, focusing on DNS, SSL certificate, and domain-related incidents. It provides clear guidance for incident classification, response team coordination, communication protocols, and recovery procedures.

### Emergency Response Objectives

- **Primary:** Minimize service disruption and protect customer data
- **Secondary:** Maintain security posture during incident response
- **Tertiary:** Preserve evidence for post-incident analysis
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** 15 minutes for critical services
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** 5 minutes for data loss

## Emergency Classifications

### Critical (P0) - Complete System Outage

**Characteristics:**
- All customer-facing services unavailable
- DNS resolution completely failed
- SSL/TLS termination failed across all services
- Security breach with active data exfiltration

**Response Time:** Immediate (0-5 minutes)
**On-Call Escalation:** Automatic page to all on-call engineers

**Examples:**
- Complete DNS zone deletion
- All SSL certificates revoked or expired
- Load balancer complete failure
- Active security attack in progress

### High (P1) - Major Service Degradation

**Characteristics:**
- 50%+ of customer traffic affected
- Critical domain services degraded
- SSL certificate validation failures
- Security vulnerability exploitation detected

**Response Time:** 15 minutes
**On-Call Escalation:** Page primary on-call engineer

**Examples:**
- DNS propagation issues affecting multiple regions
- Certificate provisioning failures
- Single critical service unavailable
- Potential security incident

### Medium (P2) - Limited Service Impact

**Characteristics:**
- <50% of customer traffic affected
- Non-critical services degraded
- SSL warnings for specific domains
- Security monitoring alerts

**Response Time:** 60 minutes
**On-Call Escalation:** Slack notification to on-call channel

**Examples:**
- Single domain DNS resolution issues
- Certificate expiration warnings
- Regional connectivity problems
- Elevated error rates in non-critical services

### Low (P3) - Monitoring and Informational

**Characteristics:**
- Performance degradation within acceptable limits
- Potential issues detected by monitoring
- Preventive maintenance required

**Response Time:** 4 hours (during business hours)
**On-Call Escalation:** Email notification

**Examples:**
- Certificate expiration in 30+ days
- DNS propagation delays
- Performance metrics outside normal range
- Scheduled maintenance planning

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MONITORING_API_TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"acknowledged_by\": \"$ACKNOWLEDGER\", \"timestamp\": \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}"

# Notify team
slack-cli send "#incident-response" "🚨 INCIDENT $INCIDENT_ID acknowledged by $ACKNOWLEDGER - Severity: $SEVERITY"

# Start incident timer
echo "$INCIDENT_ID,$SEVERITY,$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ),$ACKNOWLEDGER,ACKNOWLEDGED" >> /tmp/incident-log.csv
