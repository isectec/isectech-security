# iSECTECH Protect - Microservice Boundaries Design

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-07-31  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Task Reference:** 26.2

## Executive Summary

This document defines the microservice boundaries for the iSECTECH Protect platform based on security domain-driven design principles. Each microservice encapsulates a specific security domain with clear responsibilities, data ownership, and integration patterns.

## Design Principles

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Principles Applied

1. **Bounded Contexts:** Each security domain is a bounded context with its own ubiquitous language
2. **Single Responsibility:** Each microservice owns one security domain completely
3. **High Cohesion:** Related functionality is grouped within the same service
4. **Loose Coupling:** Services interact through well-defined APIs and events
5. **Data Ownership:** Each service owns its data and exposes it through APIs only

### Security Domain Mapping

Based on requirements analysis, we identify five core security domains:

- **Network Security Domain**
- **Application Security Domain**
- **Data Security Domain**
- **Identity & Access Domain**
- **Monitoring & Analytics Domain**
