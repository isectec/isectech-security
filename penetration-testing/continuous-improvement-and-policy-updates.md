Continuous Improvement and Security Policy Updates

Objectives

- Incorporate validated findings into hardened baselines
- Reduce MTTR and recurrence rate
- Keep policies, controls, and playbooks current with threat landscape

Inputs

- PenTest reports and exploit evidence
- BAS outcomes (MITRE ATT&CK mapped)
- SIEM detections and SOAR case outcomes
- Control effectiveness metrics and drift checks

Process (30/60/90 cadence)

1. Classify findings by severity and impact
2. Map to controls (CIS/NIST/ISO), policies, detection rules
3. Create remediation tasks with owners, SLAs, validation tests
4. Update policies/IaC baselines; add detections/playbooks
5. Re-test (automated) and verify no regression
6. Report KPIs to leadership

Deliverables

- Updated policy artifacts (OPA/Gatekeeper/Istio/Cilium)
- Updated hardening baselines (Pod Security, images, supply chain)
- New/updated detections, SOAR playbooks, and test cases
- Executive and engineering-level reports

Governance

- Security Review Board approves policy changes and exceptions
- Change logs kept in version control with linked tickets

Metrics

- Findings closure SLA compliance, recurrence rate, MTTR
- Control coverage/efficacy, detection MTTD/MTTR
- BAS scenario pass rate per ATT&CK tactic/technique
