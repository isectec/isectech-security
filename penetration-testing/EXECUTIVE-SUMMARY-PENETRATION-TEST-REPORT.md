### Detection System Analysis

**Current Security Effectiveness:** 25% of attacks detected
- **Average Detection Time:** 72+ hours (manual review only)
- **SIEM Bypass Rate:** 100% (complete evasion demonstrated)
- **Cross-Tenant Attack Detection:** 0% (completely undetected)
- **Administrative Takeover Detection:** 3 hours (manual discovery only)

### Compliance Impact Assessment

#### SOC 2 Type II Violations
- Control failures in access management (CC6.1, CC6.2)
- Monitoring and logging deficiencies (CC7.1, CC7.2)
- Data classification and handling gaps (CC6.7)

#### GDPR Compliance Failures  
- Article 25: Data protection by design failures
- Article 32: Security of processing violations
- Article 33: Breach notification delays (72+ hour detection)

#### Industry-Specific Risks
- **HIPAA:** PHI exposure across tenant boundaries
- **PCI DSS:** Payment data security control failures
- **SOX:** Financial reporting system vulnerabilities
