## Integration with Existing Security Infrastructure

### Leveraging Task 65 (Monitoring Infrastructure)
```bash
# Integrate with existing logging for attack correlation
curl -X POST "https://logging.isectech.com/api/v1/events" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MONITOR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"event_type": "penetration_test", "phase": "active_testing", "target": "api.isectech.com"}'

# Monitor test detection effectiveness
grep "penetration_test" /var/log/isectech/security.log | wc -l
```

### Leveraging Task 53 (Testing Framework)
```javascript
// Integrate security tests into existing test framework
describe('Security Penetration Tests', () => {
  test('SQL Injection Protection', async () => {
    const maliciousPayload = "' OR 1=1--";
    const response = await api.post('/users', { username: maliciousPayload });
    expect(response.status).toBe(400);
    expect(response.body.error).toContain('Invalid input');
  });
  
  test('Authentication Bypass Protection', async () => {
    const bypassAttempt = await api.get('/admin/users', {
      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer invalid_token' }
    });
    expect(bypassAttempt.status).toBe(401);
  });
});
```
