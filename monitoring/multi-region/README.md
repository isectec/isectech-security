# iSECTECH Multi-Region Monitoring System

## Overview

Comprehensive observability stack for multi-region deployment with data residency compliance, designed for production-grade monitoring of the Regional Hybrid deployment model across 5 global regions.

## Architecture

### Monitoring Components

1. **Cross-Region Health Monitoring**
   - Regional health checks every 30 seconds
   - Cross-region latency monitoring
   - DNS failover detection
   - Load balancer health assessment

2. **Data Residency Compliance Monitoring**
   - GDPR compliance monitoring (Europe regions)
   - CCPA compliance monitoring (US regions)  
   - APPI compliance monitoring (Asia-Pacific regions)
   - Real-time data flow violation detection
   - Automated compliance reporting

3. **SLI/SLO Dashboards**
   - Region-specific SLI tracking
   - Global SLO management
   - Availability monitoring (99.95% target)
   - Performance metrics (latency thresholds)
   - Error budget tracking

4. **Intelligent Alerting System**
   - Region-aware escalation policies
   - Context-enriched alerts
   - Automated correlation and deduplication
   - Business impact assessment
   - Multi-channel notification (Email, Slack, PagerDuty)

5. **Distributed Tracing**
   - Cross-region request tracing
   - Compliance-aware trace filtering
   - Performance bottleneck identification
   - Data residency trace validation

6. **Capacity Planning Metrics**
   - Resource utilization across regions
   - Traffic pattern analysis
   - Seasonal demand forecasting
   - Auto-scaling recommendations

7. **Anomaly Detection**
   - ML-powered anomaly detection
   - Regional failure prediction
   - Traffic pattern anomalies
   - Performance degradation detection

## Regions Monitored

### Primary Active Regions
- **us-central1** (US Central - CCPA) - 40% traffic weight
- **europe-west4** (Netherlands - GDPR) - 30% traffic weight  
- **asia-northeast1** (Tokyo - APPI) - 30% traffic weight

### Backup Regions
- **us-east1** (US East - CCPA backup)
- **europe-west1** (Belgium - GDPR backup)

## Data Residency Compliance

### Strict Regional Isolation
- No cross-region data transfer monitoring
- Compliance zone violation detection
- Audit trail for all data access
- Regional encryption key monitoring

### Compliance Frameworks
- **GDPR**: Article 32 security measures, Article 25 privacy by design
- **CCPA**: Data protection and breach notification requirements  
- **APPI**: Cross-border data transfer restrictions

## Monitoring Stack Components

### Core Infrastructure
- **Prometheus** - Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana** - Visualization and dashboards
- **Jaeger** - Distributed tracing
- **Elasticsearch** - Log aggregation and search
- **AlertManager** - Alert routing and notification

### Multi-Region Extensions
- **Cross-Region Health Monitor** - Custom monitoring service
- **Compliance Monitor** - Data residency validation
- **Regional SLO Tracker** - Service level objective management
- **Anomaly Detection Engine** - ML-powered anomaly detection
- **Capacity Planning System** - Resource utilization analysis
