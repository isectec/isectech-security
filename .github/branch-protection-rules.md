- Automatic review assignment based on CODEOWNERS

### Develop Branch (`develop`)
**Purpose**: Integration and staging environment
**Protection Level**: High

**Required Status Checks**:
- ✅ All CI pipeline jobs must pass
- ✅ Security scanning (quick scan)
- ✅ Unit and integration tests
- ✅ Basic code quality checks

**Branch Protection Settings**:
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Allow administrators to bypass pull request requirements (emergency only)

**Review Requirements**:
- Minimum 1 approving review required
- Automatic review assignment for complex changes

### Release Branches (`release/*`)
**Purpose**: Release preparation and testing
**Protection Level**: High

**Required Status Checks**:
- ✅ All CI/CD pipeline jobs must pass
- ✅ Comprehensive security scanning
- ✅ Full test suite execution
- ✅ Performance validation
- ✅ Release readiness checks

**Branch Protection Settings**:
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging

**Review Requirements**:
- Minimum 2 approving reviews required
- Release manager approval required

### Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/*`)
**Purpose**: Emergency production fixes
**Protection Level**: Medium (expedited process)

**Required Status Checks**:
- ✅ Critical tests must pass
- ✅ Security validation
- ✅ Smoke tests

**Branch Protection Settings**:
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Allow administrators to bypass some requirements (true emergency)

**Review Requirements**:
- Minimum 1 approving review required (can be expedited)
- Security team review for security-related hotfixes

## Automated Checks

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Secrets scanning (TruffleHog)
- Code formatting (Prettier, gofmt, black)
- Linting (ESLint, golangci-lint, pylint)
- Basic security checks

### Commit Message Requirements
All commits must follow Conventional Commits format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, security, perf, ci, build

**Examples**:
- `feat(auth): implement JWT token refresh mechanism`
- `security(api): fix SQL injection vulnerability in search endpoint`
- `fix(dashboard): resolve memory leak in real-time updates`

## Security Considerations

### Mandatory Security Reviews
Security team review is required for:
- Changes to authentication/authorization logic
- Database schema modifications
- API endpoint modifications
- Infrastructure configuration changes
- Dependency updates with security implications
- Any code touching sensitive data processing

### Vulnerability Response
- Critical vulnerabilities: Immediate hotfix process
- High vulnerabilities: Must be addressed within 24 hours
- Medium vulnerabilities: Must be addressed within 1 week
- Low vulnerabilities: Must be addressed within 1 month

### Compliance Requirements
All code changes must maintain compliance with:
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 27001 standards
- SOC 2 Type II requirements
- GDPR data protection requirements

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Bypass Process
1. Incident must be documented with severity level
2. Emergency contact (CTO/CISO) approval required
3. Post-incident review and remediation plan mandatory
4. All bypassed checks must be completed within 24 hours

### Rollback Procedures
1. Automated rollback triggers for critical failures
2. Manual rollback process for complex issues
3. Rollback validation requirements
4. Post-rollback incident analysis

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Branch Protection Violations
- Immediate Slack alerts to #security-alerts
- Email notifications to security team
- Incident ticket creation for violations
- Weekly summary reports

### Compliance Monitoring
- Daily compliance score tracking
- Automated compliance reports
- Trend analysis and alerting
- Monthly compliance reviews

## Team Responsibilities

### Security Team
- Define and maintain security policies
- Review security-related changes

### DevOps Team
- Maintain CI/CD pipeline integrity
- Infrastructure security management
- Deployment process optimization
- Monitoring and alerting systems

### Development Teams
- Follow secure coding practices

- Maintain code quality standards
- Respond to security feedback

### Quality Assurance
- Validate security test coverage
- Perform security regression testing
- Compliance validation testing
- User acceptance security testing

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly branch protection rule assessment
