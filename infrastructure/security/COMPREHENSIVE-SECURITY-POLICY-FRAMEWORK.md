## 1. Multi-Tenant Security Policy

### 1.1 Tenant Isolation Requirements

**Policy Statement:** All customer tenants must be completely isolated at data, network, and application layers to prevent cross-tenant data access or privilege escalation.

**Mandatory Controls:**
- **Database-Level Row-Level Security (RLS):** All database queries must include tenant context validation
- **API-Level Tenant Validation:** Every API endpoint must validate tenant authorization before data access
- **Network Segmentation:** Logical network isolation between tenant workloads
- **Authentication Binding:** User sessions must be cryptographically bound to specific tenant contexts

**Implementation Requirements:**
```sql
-- Database RLS Policy Example
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON customer_data
    FOR ALL TO application_role
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id'));
```

**Compliance Validation:**
- Weekly automated tenant boundary testing
- Quarterly third-party isolation verification
- Annual tenant security architecture review

### 1.2 Cross-Tenant Access Prevention

**Prohibited Activities:**
- Wildcard tenant access (`tenant_id: *`)
- Cross-tenant data queries or aggregation
- Shared authentication tokens across tenants
- Administrative functions without tenant scope validation

**Enforcement Mechanisms:**
- Real-time tenant boundary monitoring
- Automated cross-tenant access alerting
- Zero-tolerance policy for tenant boundary violations

  algorithms: ['RS256'], // ONLY RS256 allowed
  audience: 'isectech-api',
  issuer: 'isectech-auth',
  ignoreExpiration: false,
  maxAge: '1h' // Maximum token lifetime
};
```

**Prohibited Configurations:**
