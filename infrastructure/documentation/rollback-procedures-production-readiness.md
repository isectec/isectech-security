## Rollback Procedures

### 🚨 Emergency Rollback (< 5 minutes)

For critical production issues requiring immediate rollback:

#### 1. Immediate Service Rollback

```bash
# Execute automated rollback for specific service
./infrastructure/ci-cd/automated-rollback-system.sh rollback SERVICE_NAME production

# Example: Rollback auth service
./infrastructure/ci-cd/automated-rollback-system.sh rollback auth-service production
```

#### 2. Multi-Service Rollback

```bash
# Rollback all services to previous stable version
for service in frontend api-gateway auth-service asset-discovery event-processor threat-detection behavioral-analysis decision-engine nlp-assistant; do
    ./infrastructure/ci-cd/automated-rollback-system.sh rollback $service production
done
```

#### 3. Infrastructure Rollback

```bash
# Revert to previous Cloud Build configuration
gcloud builds submit --config=infrastructure/ci-cd/rollback-cloudbuild.yaml

# Revert traffic allocation
./infrastructure/ci-cd/multi-environment-deployment.sh rollback SERVICE_NAME production
```

### 📋 Planned Rollback Procedures

For planned rollbacks during maintenance windows:

#### 1. Pre-Rollback Validation

```bash
# Validate current system state
./infrastructure/monitoring/comprehensive-health-check-system.sh check-all production

# Generate pre-rollback report
./infrastructure/monitoring/uptime-monitoring-synthetic-testing.sh sla-report production 24h
```

#### 2. Execute Planned Rollback

```bash
# Step 1: Put system in maintenance mode
./infrastructure/ci-cd/multi-environment-deployment.sh maintenance production

# Step 2: Execute service rollbacks in reverse dependency order
./infrastructure/ci-cd/multi-environment-deployment.sh rollback frontend production
./infrastructure/ci-cd/multi-environment-deployment.sh rollback nlp-assistant production
./infrastructure/ci-cd/multi-environment-deployment.sh rollback decision-engine production
./infrastructure/ci-cd/multi-environment-deployment.sh rollback behavioral-analysis production
./infrastructure/ci-cd/multi-environment-deployment.sh rollback threat-detection production
./infrastructure/ci-cd/multi-environment-deployment.sh rollback event-processor production
./infrastructure/ci-cd/multi-environment-deployment.sh rollback asset-discovery production
./infrastructure/ci-cd/multi-environment-deployment.sh rollback auth-service production
./infrastructure/ci-cd/multi-environment-deployment.sh rollback api-gateway production

# Step 3: Validate rollback success
./infrastructure/testing/end-to-end-integration-testing.sh post-test

# Step 4: Exit maintenance mode
./infrastructure/ci-cd/multi-environment-deployment.sh resume production
```

#### 3. Post-Rollback Validation

```bash
# Comprehensive health validation
./infrastructure/monitoring/comprehensive-health-check-system.sh check-all production

# End-to-end testing
./infrastructure/testing/end-to-end-integration-testing.sh complete

# Authentication flow validation
./infrastructure/testing/service-endpoint-auth-validation.sh comprehensive
```

### 🔄 Rollback Decision Matrix

| Issue Severity | Response Time | Rollback Type | Authorization Required |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Critical (P0) | < 5 minutes | Automated | On-call Engineer |

## Emergency Response Procedures

### 🚨 Incident Response Workflow

#### 1. Incident Detection

**Automated Detection:**
- Health check failures
- Circuit breaker trips
- SLA threshold breaches
- Security alert triggers

**Manual Detection:**
- User reports
- Monitoring dashboard alerts
- Third-party service notifications

#### 2. Initial Response (0-5 minutes)

```bash
# Immediate triage commands
./infrastructure/monitoring/comprehensive-health-check-system.sh check-all production
./infrastructure/monitoring/circuit-breakers-reliability-patterns.sh report production
./infrastructure/monitoring/uptime-monitoring-synthetic-testing.sh synthetic-all production
```

**Triage Questions:**
- Is the issue affecting users?
- Are critical services impacted?
- Is data integrity at risk?
- Are security systems compromised?

#### 3. Escalation Matrix

| Time | Action | Responsible |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 0-5 min | Initial assessment | On-call Engineer |
| 5-15 min | Incident declared | Incident Commander |
| 15-30 min | Subject matter experts engaged | Team Leads |
| 30+ min | Management briefing | Engineering Manager |

#### 4. Communication Procedures

**Internal Communication:**
- Slack: #incidents channel
- Email: incidents@isectech.com
- Phone: Emergency contact list

**External Communication:**
- Status page updates
- Customer notifications
- Vendor notifications (if applicable)

### 🔧 Common Issue Resolution

#### Service Unavailable (HTTP 503)

```bash
# Check service health
./infrastructure/monitoring/comprehensive-health-check-system.sh check SERVICE_NAME production

# Check circuit breaker state
./infrastructure/monitoring/circuit-breakers-reliability-patterns.sh circuit-status SERVICE_NAME production

# Reset circuit breaker if needed
./infrastructure/monitoring/circuit-breakers-reliability-patterns.sh circuit-reset SERVICE_NAME production

# If still failing, execute rollback
./infrastructure/ci-cd/automated-rollback-system.sh rollback SERVICE_NAME production
```

#### Authentication Failures

```bash
# Validate auth service
./infrastructure/testing/service-endpoint-auth-validation.sh service auth-service

# Check token validation endpoints
./infrastructure/testing/service-endpoint-auth-validation.sh auth-flow valid_login

# If auth service is down, enable cached authentication
./infrastructure/monitoring/circuit-breakers-reliability-patterns.sh execute auth-service production "fallback cached_tokens"
```

#### High Latency Issues

```bash
# Check auto-scaling status
gcloud run services describe isectech-SERVICE-production --region=us-central1

# Scale up immediately if needed
gcloud run services update isectech-SERVICE-production --min-instances=5 --region=us-central1

# Check cold start optimization
./infrastructure/performance/cold-start-optimization-system.sh analyze SERVICE_NAME production
```

#### Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Check Cloud SQL instance status
gcloud sql instances describe isectech-production-db

# Check connection pooling
gcloud sql instances describe isectech-production-db --format="value(settings.ipConfiguration.authorizedNetworks)"

# Restart connection pool if needed
gcloud sql instances restart isectech-production-db
```
